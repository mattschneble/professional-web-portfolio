                NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Edmonton Oilers center Connor McDavid swept the top individual honors at the NHL Awards on Monday to cap his career-best season.

McDavid won the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player and the Ted Lindsay Award as the NHL Players' Association's most outstanding player. It was McDavid's third Hart Trophy win, after having been nominated five times. Boston Bruins star David Pastrnak finished second for MVP, while the Florida Panthers' Matthew Tkachuk was third. McDavid earned 195 first-place votes for the Hart Trophy, with Pastrnak getting the only other first-place vote.

McDavid also becomes only the third four-time recipient of the NHLPA's most outstanding player award, joining Wayne Gretzky (five) and Mario Lemieux (four).

McDavid was the most dominant offensive force in the NHL this past season. He won his fifth Art Ross Trophy for leading the league with 153 points. That was 30 points more than his previous career high, set last season, and made him the first skater since Lemieux in 1995-96 to score 150 points. McDavid won the Rocket Richard Trophy with a career-best 64 goals, as well.

After winning the Hart Trophy, McDavid gave a shoutout to his new fiancée, Lauren Kyle, saying he wouldn't be up on stage without her support.

The Bruins, who set new NHL regular-season records for wins (65) and points (135), walked away with three major awards.

Boston's Jim Montgomery won the Jack Adams Award for coach of the year, finishing ahead of Lindy Ruff of the New Jersey Devils and Dave Hakstol of the Seattle Kraken.
